<h1>Hello! Welcome to our Design for Change portal. </h1>
  <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 23pt;">Design for Change is a program that challenges youth to design and implement social change projects in their communities. Our mission is to ensure that youth have the opportunities and mentorship to strengthen and apply their character, capacity, and confidence.</span></p>
  <p>So how do we do this? Well, we believe that young people need both relevant, impactful experiences as well as guidance to become empowered contributors to their communities. Here at Design for Change, we even call our youth participants \"Change Makers\" - letting them know from the very beginning that we believe in their abilities to make and create an impact. </p>
  <p>So, Design for Change is that critical learning experience by providing the challenge to create, implement, and share a project to change their community.</p>
  <p>What else do they need? YOU! You are our Change Mentor, providing the guidance for your team of youth to develop their skills in the real world, building their confidence, and growing as makers of change.</p>
  <p>DFC depends on you and all other Change Mentors to take youth through a simple four-step process called Feel Imagine Do Share. Among other things, these stages develop your team's abilities in EMPATHY, CREATIVITY, INITIATIVE, and COLLABORATION - culminating in an amazing project that solves a problem in your community.</p>
  <p>We will provide you with knowledge, activities, training, and support throughout this portal - empowering you with the tools to guide your youth to create change. We're excited to have you on board!</p>
<!-- FEEL STAGE-->
<h1>The FEEL Stage</h1>
  <p>In FEEL your Change Makers will develop a heightened awareness of themselves and their surroundings which will lead them to feel a stronger sense of empathy - the ability to relate to, and take other people's perspective.Together awareness, empathy and working on meaningful real world issues will lead to increased engagement - change makers who will be intrinsically motivated to create positive change in their own communities.Now let's get out there and empathize!</p>
<!-- WHY FEEL -->
<h1>Why FEEL?</h1>
  <p> The FEEL stage is the critical first step to building character, capacity, and confidence as a creative problem solver. Awareness, empathy, and engagement are crucial skills to build the motivation of your young Change Makers to act as well as understanding how to act in the right way.</p>
  <p>As you know, design thinking is a problem-solving process that places the community at the center of finding solutions to problems. The best way to solve challenges is to first understand all aspects of the problem and empathize with the people that are affected by the issue.</p>
  <p>You will help your team of young people investigate what is happening around them, eventually moving them to feel a sense of empathy for the thoughts, needs, and motivations of the people they are trying to serve. It will be critical for your Change Makers to continuously engage with the community and to understand the core issue from their perspective. This will not only strengthen their capacity to FEEL, it will help them arrive at a more informed solution. </p>
  <p>Check out some research and resources below to help you in the FEEL stage!</p>

<!-- <h1>The IMAGINE Stage</h1>\n
<p>Welcome to the IMAGINE stage!</p>\n
<p>Your team has just built their motivation and empathy in identifying the community problem they want to change. Now in this stage, your Change Makers will use their creativity in collaboration with their teammates and the community to think critically about the best solution.</p>\n
<h3>Why do we ask youth to IMAGINE?</h3>\n<p>First, we want youth to practice divergent thinking - a way to generate ideas that focuses on being creative and exploring as many unique solutions as possible. It's easy for us to think there is only one \"right\" solution to a problem, and just move forward with the first idea that comes to mind because we think it \"sounds good enough.\"</p>\n
<p>But much more innovative and long-lasting projects can be found when you encourage your Change Makers to come up with and explore all of their wild and crazy ideas. And in discussing those ideas, they will practice collaborating with the team and with the community.</p>\n
<p>Then, once you have several possibilities thought out, your youth will start using convergent thinking - the critical thinking skills needed to hone in on the solution that makes the most sense for your team to solve their problem. You'll guide your youth to assess, organize, and prioritize their ideas, as well as their own interests and strengths, to discover how they want to make an impact.</p>\n
<p>In IMAGINE, your Change Makers will develop:</p>\n
<ul>
  <li>an understanding of their own creativity and ways to unlock it, as well as</li>\n
  <li>strong collaboration abilities with each other and with their community</li>\n
  <li>which will together lead to practicing relevant critical thinking as they figure out how they want to solve their community problem.</li>
</ul>\n
<p>We're excited to see what you can IMAGINE!</p>",
<h1>Why IMAGINE</h1>
<p>The IMAGINE stage is essential to turning your learnings from empathetic exploration into possible solutions. Creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking are essential components to generating as many awesome ideas and possible, to solve the problem you team has identified as being important. </p>
<p>The key to the IMAGINE stage is practicing creativity without judgment. As Nobel Prize winner Dr. Linus Pauling said, \"The best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas.\" Often when we're trying to solve a problem, we censor ourselves and judge our own thoughts as \"good\" or \"bad\" before we even write them down - we don't give ourselves the freedom of unbridled creativity. However, once we give ourselves permission to say anything, even if it's wild and crazy, we have many amazing ideas as a baseline for selecting a solution.</p>
<p>When working in a team and collaborating with others, it is critical to support each others' strengths and welcome everyone's thoughts as a way to reach your ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Only after you have many different ideas to choose from, can you start assessing which ones work best for your team. You will analyze and prioritize your team's skills and interests, as well as the feasibility of your most innovative ideas within your particular constraints. This is where you decide how to bring your most unique ideas to life!</p>

<h1>The DO Stage</h1>\n
<p>Your team has just decided how they want to solve their problem - now it's time to DO it! &nbsp;In this stage, you will hand the reins over to your Change Makers so that they can build their initiative, responsibility, and especially resilience in completing their project. &nbsp;</p>\n
<h3>What do we want youth to learn by DOing?</h3>\n
<p>Change Makers need to see how their motivation and ideas, gained from empathy and creativity, can turn into action. We all have great ideas, but sometimes we struggle in figuring out how to actually make them happen - and we don’t know if we even have it in us to achieve our goals. The transformation from just the idea of a project to reality depends on developing and understanding our own initiative and responsibility.</p>\n
<p>Initiative is our ability to actually begin and follow through on our goals, while responsibility is making independent decisions and holding ourselves accountable to each other - and us! Once your Change Makers see how to go through the steps of turning idea into action, and setting and accomplishing their own milestones, they will be amazingly equipped to do the same in the future.</p>\n<p>Even more importantly, you will guide your Change Makers to learn how to be resilient, how to recover and learn from failure. In the real world, very few things work out right the first time, but “failure” isn’t actually a bad thing - it is the way that you change and retry your ideas to work towards the best possible solution.</p>\n
<h3>In DO, your Change Makers will develop:</h3>\n
<ul>\n
  <li>the ability to initiate actions on their own,</li>\n
  <li>the responsibility to finish what they started,</li>\n
  <li>and the resilience to learn from mistakes and feedback - all crucial for them to succeed in not only this project but as lifelong Change Makers!</li>\n
</ul>\n
<p>Now go DO it!</p>",
<h1>Why DO?</h1>
<p>In the DO stage you will begin to transform your ideas and planning into action. Initiative, responsibility, and resilience are key to starting and completing your project. During this time, it will be essential for you to maintain a strong relationship with the community you are trying to serve. </p>
<p>The DO stage will help you understand that your ideas are valid and your actions can have an impact. During this time, you will be building your initiative and responsibility, and learning valuable skills that can be applied to all aspects of your life. </p>
<p>However, the most important learning from the DO stage is how to deal with what can be perceived as \"failure\". In a lot of situations, it feels like you only have one chance to get things right - on a test, a game, or doing homework - and if you do it wrong, you \"fail.” Period. Design thinking, however, focuses and encourages the process of iteration, the reworking of a solution until you are happy with the outcome. The only failure is in not trying at all. </p>
<p>The first time you try something out, DO not expect it to be perfect. After implementing your chosen action for the first time, you should reflect on everything that went well, and things that didn’t go as planned. Then, you should evaluable what could be changed in the future so you can make your project better. Your team can then begin to incorporate those learning’s, and reiterate your original solution. In this way, you will being to see your \"failures\" as feedback and lessons for the future. </p>

Now that you have almost completed or already finished your project, it’s time to SHARE it with the community. Through reflection, connection, and communication, your team will spread the news of your impact and INSPIRE others to take on projects of their own!&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Why is it so important to SHARE?</h3>\n<p>Throughout this Design for Change process, you and your team have been developing tools and skills to not only finish this one project, but bring about ongoing change - change caused by your Change Makers, but also by those inspired by them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In order to gather our thoughts and prepare to use our skills in the future, first we need to reflect. During reflection, we think about our entire journey from start to finish, both in the actions we have taken but also the lessons we have learned. &nbsp;Revisiting the bigger picture helps us get ready to apply those learnings in other situations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once your team has thought about and discovered the long-term changes in themselves, they can bring those lessons before the community. In this way they will inspire other youth and adults like them to take on their own projects of change! Your teams will revisit their empathetic abilities to connect with members of their community and communicate - in writing, speaking, music, anything they want! - the work they have done and that others can do as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In SHARE, your Change Makers will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reflect on their project, their impact, and their growth</li>\n<li>which will help them make connections between the work they have done and the community they did it in</li>\n<li>Together they will finally communicate with the community and inspire others to be the change!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Go SHARE your work with the world!</p>",

"text": "<h1>Why SHARE?</h1> <p>The SHARE stage is where you tell the world about what you have done - and how others can do it too! Reflection, connection, and communication are skills essential to being able to inspire others to take on projects of change, just as you have!</p><p>All along, you have been using design thinking to solve problems in the community. Sharing is the final piece of the puzzle. It is your opportunity to present your hard and all that you have accomplished. Too often, people keep their ideas and successes a “best kept secret” because they fear they are bragging or boasting. Sometimes, people don’t even know how and with whom they should share their project with. </p><p>The goal of Share is to carefully and thoughtfully contribute to your community’s growth by discussing the problem you chose, how you went about solving it, and the lessons you learned along the way. </p><p>At the end of the SHARE stage, you and your team should take time to reflect on what you have learned, if you think you were successful, and the impact you made. </p><p>Remember, you and your team have started an extraordinary journey of change, a journey with no beginning nor end, but instead, a cycle of amazing impact that will inspire others around the world!</p><p>Check out some research and resources below to help you in the DO stage!</p><h3>Communicating in Design Thinking</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://designthinking.ideo.com/?p=1150\" target=\"_new\">http://designthinking.ideo.com/?p=1150</a></li><li><a href=\"http://everydayinfluence.typepad.com/everyday_influence/2010/06/design-thinking-for-innovative-communication-strategies.html\">http://everydayinfluence.typepad.com/everyday_influence/2010/06/design-thinking-for-innovative-communication-strategies.html</a></li></ul><h3>Communication in the Classroom</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.cehd.umn.edu/ceed/publications/tipsheets/preschoolbehavior/posclass.pdf\" target=\"_new\">http://www.cehd.umn.edu/ceed/publications/tipsheets/preschoolbehavior/posclass.pdf</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.hdi.uky.edu/media/default/documents/research/researchbrief_summer2013.pdf\" target=\"_new\">http://www.hdi.uky.edu/media/default/documents/research/researchbrief_summer2013.pdf</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.kumon.co.uk/blog/the-importance-of-children-developing-good-communication-skills/\" target=\"_new\">http://www.kumon.co.uk/blog/the-importance-of-children-developing-good-communication-skills/</a></li></ul><h3>The Power of Inspiration</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://eduniverse.org/power-inspiration\" target=\"_new\">http://eduniverse.org/power-inspiration</a></li><li><a href=\"http://thebeawesomeblog.com/2013/09/15/the-power-of-inspiration/\" target=\"_new\">http://thebeawesomeblog.com/2013/09/15/the-power-of-inspiration/</a></li> </ul>",
